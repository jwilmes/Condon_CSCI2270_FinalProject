# Condon_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project summary:
  This is a proof of concept application called SplitTip that I would actually like to make in the future, but for 
  this final project the application will be strictly for presenting the idea of the app. It is a food ordering app
  that has the ability to split the total cost between multiple debit or credit cards. The program will present a menu
  of different restaurants to order from. The user will be prompted to select a restaurant and then a menu for that
  restuarant will be presented. The user will add whatever food items they wish to order. Then when finished the user
  will be prompted for an address. Once finished entering the delivery info, the user may add a credit card number or
  multiple credit card numbers and the total cost will be split evenly or non evenly which will be up to the user.

System Requirements:
  This program is designed to run on Linux.
